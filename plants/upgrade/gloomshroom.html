                <p class="brianne">"I've always enjoyed releasing heavy fumes," says Gloom Shroom. "I know a lot of people aren't cool with that. They say it's rude or that it smells bad. All I can say is, would you rather have your brain eaten by zombies?"</p>

            <h1 class="brianne large">Plant Description</h1>
            <ul>
             <li> The Gloom-shroom deals 80 damage per 1.9 seconds to any given target in its range, which is slower than a Gatling Pea. Its fumes can also hit every single target in its range, like the Fume-shroom, even if they have shields. As before, however, it does not have as much range (short range). </li> 
            </ul>

            <h1 class="brianne large">Strategies</h1>
            <ul>
              <li>One tactic for Pool and Survival: Endless levels is to build a two by three area of Gloom-shrooms in the right-hand side of the pool, all covered by Pumpkins. These will handle pool zombies as well as those in rows two and five. This strategy has the side effect of leaving zombies in rows one and six mostly unscathed, so although these can generally be handled with Cob Cannon shells or consumable plants, such as the Jalapeno, a better idea is to put Gloom-shrooms in the fifth and sixth columns in rows two and five, plus using Fume-shrooms in rows one and six in the fourth and fifth columns.
               <li> Another effective use is a row of Gloom-shrooms in rows two and four or five, with two Garlic at the very end. All land zombies will be moved to rows one and six and be annihilated. Snorkel Zombies and Dolphin Rider Zombies will make it necessary to add a two columns of Pumpkins on Lily Pads in the pool to allow time for the Gloom-shrooms to destroy them. This strategy is perfect for the mini-game Last Stand, since it can handle all of the zombies encountered. Their effectiveness is hampered by their short range, which makes them vulnerable to Gargantuars, Zombonis, and Catapult Zombies when planted on land, which will cause them to be smashed if said zombies reach it.
              </li>
            </ul>

            <h1 class="brianne large">Trivia</h1>
            <ul>
              <li>It is the most expensive mushroom in Plants vs. Zombies, even without including the price of the Fume-shroom.</li>
              <li>It is the only plant that looks up as opposed to the left, right, or at the screen.</li>
              <li>It is the only mushroom upgrade, since Gold Magnet is not considered a mushroom.</li>
              <li>Living up to its name, it has a constant sad expression; however, despite this, its seed packet in the Suburban Almanac in the PC and Nintendo DS versions show a picture of it like it is smiling.</li>
              <li>It, Starfruit, Cattail, Cob Cannon, and Threepeater are the only plants that can fire outside the lane they are planted on.</li>
              <li>It is ranked number two for firing in the most directions (eight), the first being Cattail (everywhere), and the third being Starfruit (five).</li>
              <li>It and Doom-shroom are the only mushrooms that do not have a design on their mushroom cap, possibly because their faces are on the mushroom cap instead of the stem.</li>
              <li>It has the shortest range of fire, only one square around itself (not including instant kills such as Chomper).</li>
              <li>It is the only upgrade that degrades its range compared to the non-upgraded version.</li>
              <li>It lacks sound effects when attacking.</li>
            </ul>
