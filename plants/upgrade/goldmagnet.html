            <h1 class="brianne large">Plant Description</h1>
            <ul>
             <li> Gold Magnet is an upgrade plant that appears in Plants vs. Zombies. It is the upgrade of Magnet-shroom. It costs $3000 to buy the seed packet from Crazy Dave's Twiddydinkies and costs 50 sun to plant, along with the 100 sun the Magnet-shroom costs.
             <li> Every five seconds, it collects up to five pieces of money on-screen, saving the player's time and allowing them to focus on attacking. It can attract both types of coins as well as diamonds.
            </li> 
            </ul>

            <h1 class="brianne large">Strategies</h1>
            <ul>
              <li>Due to their automatic money collection ability, Gold Magnets are best paired with groups of Marigolds, since the latter reliably generates money, with each Marigold generating one coin every 24 seconds. There are existing gold-farming strategies that exploit several Marigolds producing money while the enemy fruitlessly hammers away at the impenetrable outer walls, especially in Last Stand. Gold Magnets can also be useful in levels where large amounts of money are dropped by zombies, such as Survival: Endless. But otherwise, this plant has no offensive capabilities at all, and as such, it may be favorable to pick other plants over it in most levels.</li>
            </ul>

            <h1 class="brianne large">Trivia</h1>
            <ul>
              <li>It is one of the three upgrade plants that lose abilities from their downgrades (in the case of this plant, not being able to grab metal objects from zombies).</li>
              <li>It has a stem and leaves, unlike the Magnet-shroom and other mushrooms.</li>
              <li>Much like the Plantern and Flower Pot, it is based on an object rather than a plant.</li>
              <li>It uses magnetism to pick up silver coins, gold coins, and diamonds despite the fact that silver and gold are non-magnetic metals, and diamonds are not even made of metal.</li>
              <li>Because it cannot pick up coins or diamonds until they touch the ground, it will still try to pick them up; but the coins will not move, and will remain there.</li>
              <li>It and Winter Melon are the only two upgrade plants that cost less sun than their original plant.</li>
              <li>It is the cheapest upgrade plant in the game, costing only 50 sun.</li>
              <li>It may attempt to collect coins after all the coins on-screen have been cleared by clicking. It will glow and try to attract coins, but it won't attract any coins.</li>
              <li>t takes a second to magnetize coins and diamonds while Magnet-shroom instantly grabs metallic objects. The reason for this is because it has to rear back before magnetizing.</li>
              <li>If there are diamonds, gold coins, and silver coins on the screen, the Gold Magnet collects the diamonds first, then the gold coins and finally the silver ones.</li>
              <li>If you look carefully, it moves like a Blover.</li>
            </ul>
