                "I only recently became aware of the existence of zombies," says Puff-shroom. "Like many fungi, I'd just assumed they were fairy tales or movie monsters. This whole experience has been a huge eye-opener for me."</p>

            <h1 class="brianne large">Plant Description</h1>
            <ul>
             <li> Puff-shroom is a mushroom appearing Plants vs. Zombies. Although he has a limited firing range of three tiles, he does not cost any sun and can deal the same damage as a Peashooter, making him a good choice for Night and Fog levels where sun does not fall from the sky.</li> 
              <li> Puff-shrooms are cheap, but can only fire a short distance.</li>
              <li> While they have no upgrades in the main game, in both Beghouled Mini-games, Puff-shroom can be upgraded into Fume-shroom for 500 sun.</li>
            </ul>

            <h1 class="brianne large">Strategies</h1>
            <ul>
              <li>Offensively, Puff-shroom is useful as a deterrent against basic Zombies in the early game as it can kill it without taking any damage. Compared to the aforementioned plants, Puff-shroom benefits from his ability to be massed in great numbers with little negative impact and therefore will be able to last until the middle game. </li>
              <li>Defensively, Puff-shroom serves well as a makeshift wall against most enemies because of his sun cost. Puff-shroom is particularly effective in stalling Gargantuars, as they will take the same amount of time to attack a Puff-shroom as any other plant while not dealing any economical damage to the player, even in the day. Puff-shroom is also effective at forcing Pole Vaulting Zombies to jump, working well as an emergency if the player has not set up their defences yet. </li>
            </ul>

            <h1 class="brianne large">Trivia</h1>
            <ul>
              <li>He, Sun-shroom, Spikeweed, and Spikerock are the only plants which, when planted, may not be in the center of a square on the lawn. They may get planted slightly to the left, right or up.</li>
              <li>He is one of the two cheapest plants in Versus Mode, requiring only 25 sun for the cost of the Coffee Bean, with the other being the Potato Mine.</li>
              <li>Even if he is at the edge of the red line in Versus Mode, he cannot shoot the Target Zombies, as the distance is just slightly over three squares long. The only time he can shoot the Target Zombie, however, is if his spore goes past a defeated zombie about to fall down.</li>
              <li>The player will receive a warning for refusing to bring Puff-shrooms on Level 2-1. The warning will say "This Level will be extremely difficult without Puff-shrooms. Are you sure you wish to continue without them?"</li>
              <li>He can be considered as the opposite to Scaredy-shroom, as Puff-shroom can only attack zombies in a close range and Scaredy-shroom can only attack zombies in a far range, and also Puff-shroom is very short, while Scaredy-shroom is tall.</li>
              <li>Even though his spores technically come out of his mouth, if the player looks closely, it can be seen that they come out of his head. It is most likely an error.</li>
              <li>He and Sea-shroom are the only plants from the first Plants vs. Zombies game that cost 0 sun.</li>
            </ul>
