            <h1 class="brianne large">Plant Description</h1>
            <ul>
             <li> He is a defensive plant with the same health as a Wall-nut. Unlike other defensive plants, however, Pumpkin does not occupy a garden space for himself, allowing other plants to be planted inside of him, or for him to be planted on top of other plants, effectively giving another layer of protection. </li>
             <li> Pumpkin is unable to be planted on Sea-shroom, Tangle Kelp, Grave Buster, Cob Cannon, and other Pumpkins. Pumpkin can be repaired with Wall-nut First Aid if it's unlocked.</li>
            </ul>

            <h1 class="brianne large">Strategies</h1>
            <ul>
              <li>Pumpkins are excellent at later levels, where the player needs to conserve as much space as possible. Catapult Zombies and Bungee Zombies always target the plant inside the Pumpkin first, so they are useless as protection against them. They can be used to buy time so that your plants have more time to take out Digger Zombies. The best plant to put inside a Pumpkin (for defensive purposes) is the Tall-nut, so Pole Vaulting Zombies or Dolphin Rider Zombies cannot jump over them, and the zombies will have to eat the Pumpkin and Tall-nut. Note, however, that he is not as efficient, sun-wise, as a Tall-nut alone; a Tall-nut and Pumpkin combo costs as much as two Tall-nuts, yet has only as much health as one-and-a-half. They are also useful for plants that the Imitater duplicates because he protects them as they transform. </li>
            </ul>

            <h1 class="brianne large">Trivia</h1>
            <ul>
              <li>He has a second degrade that can only be seen in the "reanim" folder, where the game stores his images.</li>
              <li>For some reason, the player can place Pumpkins on top of a Spikeweed or a Spikerock. If they place a Pumpkin on top of a Spikeweed when there is a zombie on it, the zombie will eat the Pumpkin and at the same time be attacked by the Spikeweed.</li>
              <li>Puff-shroom is too small for a Pumpkin, but when he shoots a spore, the spore somehow passes through the Pumpkin's shell and still damages the zombies, which is unusual, though it could be going out through the Pumpkin's holes.</li>
              <li>When a Pumpkin with a plant inside is squashed, he will have a flattened animation of the plant above a flattened Pumpkin instead of a flattened version of the plant in the Pumpkin.</li>
              <li>Starfruit lies on his back, but if a Pumpkin is added, he will stand up (as he would otherwise be completely concealed within him).</li>
              <li>He cannot be planted on Sea-shroom and Tangle Kelp, as they are aquatic plants. They can still be planted on Cattails however, because she is the upgrade for the Lily Pad. He also cannot protect Cob Cannon and Grave Buster, because Cob Cannon is too big to fit and Grave Buster cannot be protected because he is on a grave, and graves cannot be planted on.</li>
              <li>There is a way to dig him up without digging up the plant inside him. Try using a shovel on the bottom of the square he is on.</li>
              <li>If Chomper is in Pumpkin, when the Chomper sways to the right, his lower lip seems to go through Pumpkin.</li>
              <li>He prevents plants such as Gloom-shroom and Squash that are behind him from hitting zombies in front of him, as the Pumpkin has a slightly larger hitbox.</li>
              <li>Putting him on plants is almost always advantageous, except when Zombonis, Catapult Zombies, Gargantuars, or Giga-gargantuars appear; putting a Pumpkin on the front plant actually increases the chance of them being squashed. This is because Pumpkin has a larger hitbox than normal plants.</li>
              <li>His flattened sprite can still be removed by a shovel (only applies if the sprite is there and before it disappears).</li>
            </ul>
