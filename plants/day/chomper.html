                Chomper almost got a gig doing stunts for The Little Shop of Horrors but it fell through when his agent demanded too much on the front end. Chomper's not resentful, though. He says it's just part of the business. </p>

            <h1 class="brianne large">Plant Description</h1>
            <ul>
             <li> Chomper is a multi-use instant-kill plant appearing in Plants vs. Zombies. </li>
             <li> He can eat zombies whole, killing them instantly, but is vulnerable to attacks when chewing.</li>
             <li>After eating an enemy, Chomper will require 42 seconds before he can eat another, making him vulnerable, exposing itself to other zombies' attacks in the process.</li>
            </ul>

            <h1 class="brianne large">Strategies</h1>
            <ul>
              <li>Chomper's main value in the plant arsenal is found in his ability to instantly devour tougher zombies such as Buckethead Zombies, Zombonis, and Football Zombies, who would otherwise be able to soak up a considerable amount of damage and allow their comrades to advance. However, this comes at a great price, as Chomper will be rendered inactive for a very long while and exposing himself to attacks after devouring an enemy, regardless of who the victim was - a basic Zombie and a Football Zombie will take the same amount of time to be digested. Chomper also has dismal performance against Gargantuars, due to his low range and bite damage. </li>
            </ul>
            
            <h1 class="brianne large">Trivia</h1>
            <ul>
              <li>If Chomper is smashed, his flattened sprite will always have no zombies or arms, and will have an open mouth regardless of whether he was chomping a zombie or not.</li>
              <li>If Chomper is planted directly in front of a bobsled and Chomper eats the bobsled before it breaks, he will instantly devour all four zombies inside, saving lots of time.</li>
              <li>According to the Plants vs. Zombies website, Chomper costs 175 sun, while in-game, he actually costs 150.</li>
              <li>Chomper's Almanac entry states that he was going to be a movie star, explicitly referencing the movie Little Shop of Horrors. This may be due to the fact that Chomper resembles Audrey II, the carnivorous monster plant from that movie.</li>
              <li>Chomper, Sunflower, Peashooter, Repeater, Wall-nut, Tall-nut, and Cactus are the plants that appear on the start menu, but in this art, he has no spikes on his head.</li>
              <li>In the art cover of the Plants vs. Zombies Original Soundtrack, he is visible singing along with the Squash and Sun-shroom. This version has three spikes on his head, while the in-game Chomper has four.</li>
              <li>When a Pole Vaulting Zombie that has its pole runs into a Chomper that isn't chewing, he will attempt to chomp, but fail to catch the vaulting zombie. This is not the case if the Pole Vaulting Zombie is frozen or buttered.</li>
              <li>If player pauses the game and exits to the main menu while Chomper tries to devour a Gargantuar then loads the saved game, the Chomper will appear as if he is already "devouring" a zombie: this is most likely a programming glitch.</li>
              <li>According to the Tree of Wisdom, Chomper and Wall-nut were roommates in college. This is an obvious reference to their efficient synergy.</li>
              <li>Chomper is the only instant kill that can't kill a Gargantuar in 2 hits, or a Giga-gargantuar in 4. This is likely both due to Gargantuars being too big for Chomper's bites to inflict significant damage, as well as for balancing reasons; if a Chomper could kill a Gargantuar in just 2 bites, it would make them too easy to deal with.</li>
