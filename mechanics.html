          <h1 class="brianne text-light">Adventure Mode</h1> 
          <p>Adventure Mode is the first available mode and the main mode in Plants vs. Zombies. There are five groups of ten levels, which are Day, Night, Pool, Fog, and Roof; each with their own characteristics. A new plant is unlocked and added to the player's roster at the end of most levels, and in the other levels the player receives an item or a note.
            <br><br>
            When playing Adventure Mode for the first time: <br> </p>
            <ul>
               <li> At the end of first through third and fifth through eighth levels, a new seed packet is obtained. </li> 
                <li>At every first, third, sixth and eighth level, a new zombie is encountered.</li>
                <li>At the end of the fourth level, an item is obtained.</li>
                <li>The fifth level is a mini-game, and a seed packet is obtained at the end of it.</li>
                <li>A note from the zombies is obtained at the end of the ninth level.</li>
                <li>The tenth level is a conveyor-belt level, and a seed packet that is important for the next area is obtained at the end of it.</li>
                <li>At the end of Level 5-10, the player just gets another note from the zombies saying they give up and the Silver Sunflower Trophy at the first time.</li>
            </ul>

          <h1 class="brianne text-light">Survival Mode</h1> 
            <p>Survival Mode is a game mode in Plants vs. Zombies where the player is tasked to survive continuous waves of zombies. It is unlocked when Adventure Mode is completed for the first time (after beating Dr. Zomboss in the final level and earning the Silver Sunflower Trophy).
                <br><br>
                Unlike the levels in Adventure Mode, the player is allowed to choose different seed packets to defend against the zombies every one or two flags (for normal and hard/endless versions respectively) to continue building up their defenses. After each wave, the player is allowed to replace their chosen seed packets with others if they wish to do so. For each wave of zombies passed, their plants and their sun bank remain unchanged, but any lost Lawn Mowers, Pool Cleaners, or Roof Cleaners will not be restored. At the end of the first completion of each Survival level, a trophy is received with a diamond, along with gold coins for any remaining Lawn Mowers, Pool Cleaners, or Roof Cleaners. Subsequent completions will yield a money bag. The normal modes last five waves, hard modes last ten flags (two flags per wave), and Survival: Endless continues indefinitely until either the zombies eat the player's brains or the level is restarted.</p>

          <h1 class="brianne text-light">Mini-Games</h1> 
            <p>Mini-games is a game mode found in most versions of Plants vs. Zombies. They are accessed through the main menu below Adventure Mode or through the More Ways To Play menu on the iOS, Android, PlayStation 3, PlayStation Vita, and Xbox 360 versions of the game. Mini-games are a collection of levels that have the player choose plants, use a conveyor belt to provide plants or force the player to use a set of plants to complete a certain goal. There are 20 mini-games in most versions with various unique twists, such as smaller zombies and zombies with plants for heads. Many of them are closely related to PopCap's other games (e.g. Beghouled and Beghouled Twist being based on Bejeweled and Bejeweled Twist respectively, and Zombiquarium being based on Insaniquarium). Sometimes, a mini-game will be replaced with another one on certain versions. On the iOS and Game of the Year versions, beating all the mini-games present will earn the player the achievement: Beyond the Grave. However, in mobile versions the player must buy them.
                <br><br>
                Mini-games can be found for the first time in a present dropped by a zombie in Level 3-2 of Adventure Mode. The mini-games initially available are ZomBotany, Wall-nut Bowling, and Slot Machine. The player can unlock many more mini-games after the completion of Adventure Mode. Each mini-game yields one trophy which is worth a diamond after the first completion, and a bag with five gold coins in subsequent plays.</p>

          <h1 class="brianne text-light">Puzzle Mode</h1> 
          <p>Puzzle Mode is a game mode in Plants vs. Zombies that consists of two (three in the iOS and Android versions) separate puzzle types. It is unlocked in Level 4-6 by receiving a present that is dropped by a random zombie in the level. However, the player cannot try out the full Puzzle Mode until they complete Adventure Mode. In the iOS and Android versions of Plants vs. Zombies, the player must purchase the Vasebreaker, I, Zombie, and Last Stand game packs. Otherwise, they can only play the first level in each section before needing to buy the rest. Both Vasebreaker and I, Zombie cost 150,000 coins, while Last Stand costs 100,000 coins. </p>
