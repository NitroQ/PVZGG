# 🧟 Plants Vs. Zombies Game Guide Website

This is a project done entirely with pure HTML and CSS/SCSS. As a submission to our Web Development Subject as a project. 

### Goal
The goal of this project is to demonstrate our skills using Raw HTML and CSS to provide an audience-targeted, simple and intuitive website. We have created a Game Wiki Website with the theme and topic of Plants Vs. Zombies.

The goal of the website is to provide useful knowledge, helpful tips and information about the game, Plants Vs. Zombies, exclusively the Desktop edition of the game. In order to walkthrough gamers in what they could expect or possibly use in a certain level or when they are about to get onto that level.
