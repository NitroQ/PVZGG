            <h1 class="brianne large">Zombie Description</h1>
            <ul>
             <li> Zombies are the most basic of all the "zombie" units. Having no special defensive equipment or travel abilities, these zombies are susceptible to any type of attack and are slow to approach the player's house. They are found in most levels and are the first zombies the player encounters.</li> 
           </ul>

            <h1 class="brianne large">Strategies</h1>
            <ul>
                <li>In a standard Adventure or Survival Mode level, Zombies will be the first to appear and will start the assault in approximately 20 seconds or the time it would take the player to plant three Sunflowers (or Sun-shrooms), as measured during a daytime (or nighttime) level. They can be killed by planting a Potato Mine three spaces away from the zombie, purchasing the Garden Rake from Crazy Dave's Twiddydinkies, or planting relatively cheap offensive plants like Peashooters or Cabbage-pults. For Night levels, you can use mushrooms, like Puff-shrooms and Scaredy-shrooms. One Puff-shroom, despite its short range, will be able to take a single zombie out on its own. However, repeated attacks may be able to kill the Puff-shroom. The Tangle Kelp provides an aquatic Potato Mine-style plant in Pool levels, except only one zombie can be killed per Tangle Kelp. For dealing with large volumes of zombies, more expensive additions such as the Torchwood and Melon-pult are available, in addition to instant kills such as the Jalapeno, Cherry Bomb and Doom-shroom. Some plants, such as the Repeater and the Fume-shroom, can be upgraded to increase efficiency and give them new abilities. Zombies can eat your plants and brains, where it is then the player loses the level and try or start that same level again if it does eat your brains (the same also applies to other types of zombies). Any offensive plant can kill one of them, except when planted right in front of them. Two Spikeweeds or a Spikerock will be enough to kill a regular zombie 90% of the time, but because of slight speed variations, the player may need three Spikeweeds or a Spikerock and Spikeweed to kill them.</li>
            </ul>
            <h1 class="brianne large">Trivia</h1>
            <ul>
              <li>At the start of the level, the player can hear a zombie mutter, "The zombies...are coming...", and growl. This could mean that the zombie still remembers a small part of human speech. However, it is unknown if the zombies themselves are saying this or simply an anonymous narrator, leaving this debatable.</li>
              <li>Zombie is the first zombie the player encounters.</li>
              <li>Zombie is the only zombie to be used as a weapon for the Gargantuar.</li>
              <li>If any zombie that can degrade to this zombie is killed by an explosive after losing its arm but before losing its head, its lost arm will regrow before it falls into a pile of ashes. The only exception to this is the Ducky Tube Zombies in the pool, which will just disappear instead.</li>
              <li>However, if a Ducky Tube Zombie is blown up before he enters the pool, he will turn into ashes like a normal zombie.</li>
            </ul>
