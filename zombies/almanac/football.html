                    he's on the field. He's a team player who
                    delivers both offensively and defensively.
                    He has no idea what a football is.</p>  </div>

        <div class="half-description">
            <h1 class="brianne large">Zombie Description</h1>
            <ul>
             <li> Football Zombie is a zombie which first appeared in Plants vs. Zombies, Plants vs. Zombies: Journey to the West and Plants vs. Zombies: Great Wall Edition. Football Zombie first appears in Level 2-6, and he is the eighth zombie encountered in Adventure Mode.      </li> 
             <li> Football Zombie without a helmet is only as strong as a Zombie, but the zombie cannot be damaged until his helmet is destroyed, like with other headwear zombies, or stolen by a Magnet-shroom. There is also a Giga version that is only found in the Plants vs. Zombies Web Version. </li>

             </ul>

           <h1 class="brianne large">Strategies</h1>
            <ul>
              <li> The player obtains the Hypno-shroom after beating Level 2-5, so they can try to hypnotize the Football Zombie to make the level easier when instant kills are not enough, and the Football Zombie is just as effective for the player as against them.   </li>
              <li> The Suburban Almanac also advises the use of a Magnet-shroom, reducing the maximum absorption to 270 damage per shot, so it can also be used to significantly weaken him. Otherwise, this zombie is very dangerous, being fast and having very high health, so tons of firepower will have to be piled onto him in order to defeat him. The most important thing is to not underestimate him.  </li>
            </ul>

            <h1 class="brianne large">Trivia</h1>
            <ul>
              <li> In Zombies On Your Lawn, the Football Zombie states that he used to play football, contrary to his almanac description which states that he does not know what a football is.</li>
              <li> However, as the first part of the description implies that he used to play the sport, he might be only unable to recognize a football.</li>
              <li> Most zombies lose their left arm when they take enough damage. The Football Zombie loses his right arm instead (unless he has eaten a Hypno-shroom).</li>
              <li> Football Zombie, Dancing Zombie (when moonwalking), Zombie Yeti, and the hypnotized zombies (excluding Football Zombie) are the only zombies in Plants vs. Zombies that lose their right arm before death.</li>
              <li> If a Football Zombie chews on a Garlic, he will not stop and make a face, but he will instead go instantly to another lane.</li>
              <li> Football Zombie himself has the same health as a regular zombie (ten hit points); the only reason why his toughness is so high is because of his helmet, which absorbs seventy hit points. Because of this, Football Zombie's hit points are on par with an Imp, despite him being much bigger than the Imp, and he has less hit points than a Pole Vaulting Zombie or Ladder Zombie (seventeen hit points each).</li>
            </ul>
