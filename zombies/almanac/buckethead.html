            <ul>
             <li> Buckethead Zombies are zombies with buckets on their heads, increasing their toughness. The bucket does not weaken the plants' effects though. One of their weaknesses is the Magnet-shroom, as it removes the buckets, rendering these zombies as tough as normal zombies.Buckethead Zombies are zombies with buckets on their heads, increasing their toughness.

           </ul>

           <h1 class="brianne large">Strategies</h1>
            <ul>
              <li> In the early levels, it is good to have two Peashooters against it. A Snow Pea with three Spikeweeds is sufficient, due to the slowing effect which makes the zombie spend more time walking on the Spikeweeds.
                Although the Snow Pea is also a good weapon of choice, it is not recommended to do so for the sake of sun being wasted if it doesn't work. It is advised, however to use Threepeaters, Repeaters, or Gatling Peas in conjunction with a Torchwood. The Suburban Almanac advises the use of a Magnet-shroom, reducing the maximum absorption to 270 damage per shot; however, it is not needed. You may want to use instant kills for them, such as the Squash, Potato Mine , and Tangle Kelp . These zombies make up the majority of the offense in Survival: Endless. One Snow Pea and one Peashooter is sufficient to kill a Buckethead Zombie, mainly due to the slowing effect. If they appear in the Night levels, you can use the Hypno-shroom on the Buckethead Zombie if your defenses are not yet set up. Using a Wall-nut or Tall-nut and a Repeater works, but the Wall-nut or Tall-nut will be eaten or severely damaged if you try that.</li>
            </ul>

            <h1 class="brianne large">Trivia</h1>
            <ul>
             <li> In Plants vs. Zombies Risk, the Buckethead Zombie's card does not have a red stain on its bucket.</li> 
             <li> The red stain on the bucket could be one of the main reasons why Plants vs. Zombies is rated E10+ by the ESRB. In the official rating summary of the game, it describes that "one variety of zombie wears a bucket with a small streak of blood on it."</li> 
             <li> However, according to early concept art (right of this paragraph), the buckethead zombie was designed as a painter with the empty bucket over his head, and therefore the stain was simply red paint. The painter design never made it into the final game, however.</li> 
             <li> The Bucket is available as a hat for the player's avatar in the Xbox Live Marketplace. It costs 160 Microsoft Points.</li>
